      <p class="lg:pl-6 lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Our project integrates Angular, Spring Boot, and Neo4j to create a robust, full-stack web application. The front end, built with Angular, provides a dynamic and responsive user interface that interacts seamlessly with the back end powered by Spring Boot. Spring Boot handles the application's business logic and serves as the middleware that processes client requests and communicates with the Neo4j database. Neo4j, a graph-based NoSQL database, efficiently manages and queries complex relationships and interconnected data, enhancing the application's performance and scalability. This combination leverages Angular's powerful client-side capabilities, Spring Boot's ease of development for RESTful services, and Neo4j's graph database strengths to deliver a highly responsive and scalable web application</p>
